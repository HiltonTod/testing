Currently in the middle of a career shift, I picked up this book 
looking to find some encouragement and inspiration in dealing 
with the changes. While this was plentiful, what struck me the 
most was how it made me look at my hobbies and other interests 
with a different perspective.

I found myself filled with energy and ideas while reading Dream 
Year. The blank pages in the back are brimming with my notes about 
various "dream" projects. In fact, they spilled over into my 
brainstorming journal. Arment's suggestions would inspire my mind 
so much that I stopped reading it before bed, my brain racing in 
so many different directions, feeling too excited and unable to 
roll over to sleep.
