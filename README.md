# The bits & pieces that make up my personal site and blogs #

The markdown files are automatically transformed by Jekyll into a static site when I build them locally or commit to this GitHub repository. It makes life simple.

I've lost blog sites in the past when they were hosted on a database in some company's server farm. Anyone remember MSN Live Spaces? This process allows me to author in Markdown and customize the site however I like. Best of all, the files are static .html pages, making them easy to backup and move around so I never lose data again.
